In the next two or three semesters, I will focus on these three projects and extend
the proposed methods with new experiment results and observations.

Table~\ref{tab:schedule} shows the estimated timeline for each project. I will focus on AMR parsing and probabilistic decipherment from the beginning of 
2016 Fall. The estimated time for implementing the proposed work is one semester, and the target conferences 
include NAACL (estimated early Jan.), IJCAI (Feb. 19) and EACL in 2017.
I will spend part of 2016 Fall on the phrase embedding work and focus more on this direction from 2017 Spring. The estimated time for implementing the proposed work and finish the corresponding experiments is 
by the end of 2017 Spring semester. The target conferences would include ACL (estimated early Mar.) and EMNLP (estimated end of May).
There could also be extensions of the proposed methods. I will try new models and wrap up remained work on these projects during 2017 Fall.
