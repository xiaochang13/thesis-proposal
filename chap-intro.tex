MCMC algorithms is useful in reducing the search space.


The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Chapter 2, I will discuss the MCMC algorithms in general. Chapter 3-6 will separately introduce the application of MCMC algorithms to 
semantic parsing, decipherment-based machine translation, distributed representation learning and neural machine translation. In Chapter 7, I conclude the proposal paper.
