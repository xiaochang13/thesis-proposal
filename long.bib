                 point out the problem of using word-based models in
                 large vocabulary recognition systems. Namely, the
                 number of Markov parameters and the amount of training
                 data grow linearly with the size of the vocabulary. One
                 solution is to decompose the words into smaller
                 recognition units. However the performance of systems
                 which use sub-word models is not as good as those
                 systems using word models. One explanation for this
                 degradation in performance is that the word-based
                 models can model words at a finer level of detail.",

  ABSTRACT = {Non-terminally separated (NTS) languages are a subclass of
deterministic context free languages where there is a stable relationship
between the substrings of the language and the non-terminals of the
grammar. 
We show that when the distribution of samples is generated by a PCFG,
based on the same grammar as the target language, 
the class of unambiguous NTS languages is PAC-learnable from
positive data alone, with
polynomial bounds on data and computation.

 title="Learning Probabilistic Models of Relational Structure",
 author="Lise Getoor and Nir Friedman and Daphne Koller and Ben Taskar",
 Abstract={
Most real-world data is stored in relational form. In contrast, most statistical learning methods work with "flat" data representations, forcing us to convert our data into a form that loses much of the relational structure. The recently introduced framework of probabilistic relational models (PRMs) allows us to represent probabilistic models over multiple entities that utilize the relations between them. In this paper, we propose the use of probabilistic models not only for the attributes in a relational model, but for the relational structure itself. We propose two mechanisms for modeling structural uncertainty: reference uncertainty and existence uncertainty. We describe the appropriate conditions for using each model and present learning algorithms for each. We present experimental results showing that the learned models can be used to predict relational structure and, moreover, the observed relational structure can be used to provide better predictions for the attributes in the model.},

                 which has two stages of processing. The first stage is
                 a bank of 85 filters equally spaced on a log frequency
                 scale simulating the cochlea. The filters cover the
                 frequency range from 200 Hz to 3.2 kHz. The second
                 stage performs timing synchrony measurement. This model
                 was applied to a speaker dependent isolated-word speech
                 recognition task. Results showed an advantage for the
                 EIH model over traditional Fourier power spectrum for
                 noisy speech. For noise-free speech, the two systems
                 were not significantly different.",

                 filters were designed to reflect basilar membrane
                 tuning curves. The filters were spaced half a bark
                 apart to cover the range from 100 Hz to about 3.3 kHz.
                 The slope of the filters was about 6 dB/octave on the
                 low frequency side and 100 dB/octave on the high
                 frequency side. \newline Two 32-point spectral
                 representations were produced by passing the output of
                 the filtering stage through two separate non-linear
                 processes. One process was used to detect onsets and
                 the other to detect periodicity in the speech signal.
                 \newline This model was used as a front end for a
                 speech recognizer. Performance was compared with a
                 model consisting of the log-energy output of a
                 20-channel mel-scale FFT-based filterbank. The auditory

                 consists of six main stages of processing. Stage 1
                 models the outer ear and middle ear. Stage 2 models the
                 basilar membrane's mechanical filtering. Stage 3 is a
                 hair-cell simulator. Stage 4 computes the
                 autocorrelation functions (ACFs) for each of the hair
                 cell channels. In stage 5, the ACFs from each channel
                 are summed to form a pooled ACF\@. Finally, in stage 6,
                 the pitch of the signal is extracted from the pooled
                 ACF. \newline The main motive behind the use of this
                 model was in the identification of vowels with
                 different fundamental frequencies. The model was
                 successful in simulating perceptual data on
                 simultaneous vowel identification.",

Shortest hyperpath models have been proposed for several problems in different areas, for example in relation with routing in dynamic networks. However, the K shortest hyperpaths problem has not yet been investigated. \par In this paper we present procedures for finding the K shortest hyperpaths in a directed hypergraph. This is done by extending existing algorithms for K shortest loopless paths. Computational experiments on the proposed procedures are performed, and applications in transportation, planning and combinatorial optimization are discussed.},

                 the structure of these models. The method of adaptation
                 is to extract boundaries for the words in a sentence
                 during the recognition process. For each word in the
                 sentence, a new baseform can be derived from the label
                 sequence corresponding to that word. The old baseforms
                 can then be updated using the new baseform label
                 sequences. Using this method, the system will adapt to

                 which has three stages of processing. The first stage
                 consists of a bank of 40 overlapping linear
                 critical-band filters covering the frequency range from
                 130 Hz to 6.4 kHz. The second stage is a
                 hair-cell/synapse model to capture features of the
                 transformation from basilar membrane vibration to nerve
                 fiber probabilistic response. In the third stage, the
                 output from stage two is processed by two independent
                 modules. The first module is used to detect the
                 envelope response, the second is used to detect the
                 synchronous response. \newline No speech recognition
                 experiments are reported here. Suggestions on how this
                 model might be used in a speech recognition system are
                 given. For example, she suggests that the envelope
                 response might be used for marking acoustic boundaries
                 and for making broad phonetic category decisions.",

    We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering
    problem, the generic problem encountered in problems such as reference
    matching, coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record
    linkage.  Our clustering model is based on the non-parametric
    Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to define distributions over
    the countably infinite sets that naturally arise in this problem.  We
    add \emph{supervision} to our model by positing the existence of a set
    of unobserved random variables (we call these ``reference types'')
    that are generic across all clusters.  Inference in our framework,
    which require integrating over infinitely many parameters, is solved
    using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.  We present algorithms for
    both conjugate and non-conjugate priors.  We present a simple -- but
    general -- parameterization of our model based on a Gaussian
    assumption.  We evaluate this model on one artificial task and three
    real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and
    state-of-the-art supervised algorithms.  Our results show that our
    model is able to outperform other models for this task across a
    variety of performance metrics.

More than half of the world speak medium density languages, yet many of the methods appropriate for high or low density languages yield suboptimal results when applied to the medium density case. In this paper we describe a general methodology for rapidly collecting, building, and aligning parallel corpora for medium density languages, illustrating our main points on the case of Hungarian, Romanian, and Slovenian. We also describe and evaluate the hybrid sentence alignment method we are using.}

It is shown that the matrices generated have some desirable properties. The resulting algorithms are tested numerically and compared with several well-known methods.},

  "A regular tree grammar is very similar in appearance to the more familiar context-free grammars (CFGs), but has a notion of states."
  "An RTG is a lot like a CFG. It has start symbols, which we now call states,
   and it has rules. The rules in an RTG have a single state on the left, and a
   tree on the right. Like the “string” way of operating a CFG, we start with
   the start state, then repeatedly erase states and in their place write down
   the right sides of the rules we used (which now are trees), until there are no
   states left to replace."
  -RTGs support extended right hand sides of rules.
  -Tiburon cleanly performs intersection of RTGs, which naturally supports testing if a language contains a specific tree.
  -Tiburon actually uses WRTGs and does top-k tree generation, language counting, and random tree generation.  It also natively supports listing only the yields of those trees.
  -Tiburon supports determinization -- which forces each tree to have a single unique derivation.
  "Like for RTGs, a transducer has a start state and a set of rules. However,
   while an RTG had a state on the left and a tree on the right, an FTTT has
   a state and a tree on the left and a tree on the right. The left side specifies
   what the transducer should expect (i.e. which state it should be in and which
   tree it should see) and the right side specifies what to do."
  - Tiburon supports FTTT rules with variables, which may optionally be restricted to vary over trees with a particular root label.
  "The tree is passed in through echo and pipe, and interpreted as the left most item in the transducer
   chain.. Tiburon should output an RTG. This is an example of the application
   operation. In general, a tree left-applied to a FTTT produces an RTG" - so Tiburon can take a FTTT and an input tree and convert it to an RTG
  - Tiburon also supports weighted FTTTs and finite tree-to-string transducers (FTSTs)
  - Tiburon can set the weights of a FTTT or FTSG so that the weight of a set of trees (or strings) is maximal.  (learning via EM)
